      "message": "The patch as-is doesn\u0027t change the shebang back, it\u0027s just the last version of it â€” the commit message describes the changes in the patch, not the history of the patch.\n\nTo make things even better, I\u0027d start with the end-user behavioural change being implemented (in the summary):\n\n    Delete /opt/opendaylight on package purge\n\n    This patch adds a postrm script which deletes /opt/opendaylight on purge. This deletes user data and configuration.\n\n    Also correct README.Debian, using the systemd unit to start OpenDaylight.",
