For example, if you wanted some file to end up installed (after installation of the package) in /etc/opendaylight/config.cfg, you\u0027d create it as debian/opendaylight/etc/opendaylight/config.cfg (don\u0027t do this, it\u0027s just an example). You need to take the contents of the ODL tarball and place them appropriately so they end up packaged.",
