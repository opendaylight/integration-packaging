Need to update the README here and Deployment wiki at least https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Deployment#RPM_Building\n\nI\u0027m also a fan of `./build.py -v 5 0` and similar simple commands, vs digging up URLs for common builds. One option would be to keep the current -v arg and when iterating over pre-defined builds below, instead of matching URLs, extract the version info from the pre-defined URL and compare it to the passed-by-arg version info.",
