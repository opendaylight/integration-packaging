I haven\u0027t quite figured out the best way to share image assets via config yet.\n\nI know what Trevor\u0027s proposed on the OPNFV side is to create a custom theme and repackage the image assets in the theme, but that seems like an extra dependency (and software release) to manage. It would be nice if we can somehow solve this issue purely inside lfdocs-conf project.",
