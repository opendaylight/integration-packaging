# ODL version translation
# Note that the RPM is shifting ODL's version to the left by one value
#   to be consistent with the major.minor.patch scheme used universally
#   by RPMs. ODL's version is currently prefixed with a static, useless
#   leading 0, which is widely ignored in practice. For now the version
#   translation happens here. This will likely be fixed as ODL moves to
#   a continuous release model.
