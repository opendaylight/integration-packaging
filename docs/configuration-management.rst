Configuration Management
========================

The Configuration Management Layer of the packaging and delivery stack
provided by upstream OpenDaylight installs OpenDaylight via the Packaging
Layer and then does any additional configuration required by the particular
deployment's requirements. Examples include setting Karaf features to install
at boot, remapping OpenDaylight ports, opening OpenDaylight ports in firewalld
and managing OpenDaylight's systemd service. As additional knobs are required
to configure deployments, upstream support should be added here.
