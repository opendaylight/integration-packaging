Distribution Job Builds
=======================

Unlike autorelease builds, which build every project from source, distribution
jobs only build a few Karaf features. This makes them much quicker (minutes
instead of ~11 hours), and therefore suitable for CI testing. End-users like
OPNFV should stick with autorelease jobs.


Snapshot Builds
---------------

Distribution job builds are typically kicked off when a patch is merged into
a project. Projects define `<project>`-merge-<branch> Jenkins jobs, which are
kicked off by a Gerrit merge events. To find the merge job for a Gerrit, look
for comments from the jenkins-releng user like "Build Started
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/job/netvirt-merge-boron/216/".

Alternatively, browse a project's Jenkins tab and look at the recent runs.
For example, go to https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/, select Merge-Boron
and you'll find the list of all projects merge jobs in the format
`<project>`-merge-boron. Click any to view the recent build job details and
logs.

For each active branch, snapshot builds created by distribution jobs can be
found in the subdirs at `opendaylight.snapshot/org/opendaylight/integration
/distribution-karaf/`_. The maven-metadata.xml tells about the different
versions and the latest one. The different subdirectories (say, 0.5.2-SNAPSHOT)
contain all the corresponding version (0.5.2 here) builds stored by time (time
included in the artifact name).

Recent build artifacts info for a given branch can be found in the XML's
`<content-item>` at `opendaylight.snapshot/content/org/opendaylight/integration
/distribution-karaf/`_.


Custom Distributions
--------------------

Distributions can be built with an additional set of unmerged patches. `See
this wiki`_.
