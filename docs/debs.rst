Debs
====

The `build.py`_ helper script is used for building OpenDaylight .debs. It can
build a set of .debs based on provided version arguments. The dynamic aspects
of builds, such as ODL and deb version info, have all been extracted to single
YAML configuration file.

The variables available for configuration and instructions on how to install
are documented `here`_.
