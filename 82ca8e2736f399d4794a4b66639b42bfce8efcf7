      "message": "Whoa, this file enables many checks. I guess we have a compatible .editorconfig file to go with it?\n\nAnyway, my question is: Does coala support inheritance? Ideally, Odlparent would host a big coala file with reasonable defaults (like it does with odlparent:odlparent pom file and checkstyle configuration) and projects would contain just a small file with overrides (such as line 2 here).",
